# Claude

## Programming projects

- do not add comments throughout code
- keep functions small, ideally less than 10 lines
- compile code changes
- run tests after changes
- do not commit to repo when tests fail
- Look for a claude-examples directory in projects to use as a guide for style
- include claude as co-author in commits but do not use an email address, just say: Co-Authored-By: Claude Code
